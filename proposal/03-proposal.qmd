# The proposal
<!--
How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you
will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and
how will you recover from them?

This is where the proposal should be outlined.
-->

This project involves developing three R packages. The connection between the three packages follows the way a child observes a museum and learns from it. For example, the human process can be described as: (i) visiting a museum, (ii) exploring the artifacts with a tour guide, and (iii) drawing or recreating them when returning home.

Phase 1: `museum` package (Month 1- Month 3)

This package is like a museum where we prepare a database of artifacts.

- Collect images of artifacts, historical paintings 

- Standardize images (format, resolution, glare removal)

- Development of `museum` package

Phase 2: `museumguide` (Month 3- Month 8)

- This package is like  a museum tour guide, who explains the things within the museum as outlined in the problem definition section

Phase 3: `geommandalas` (Month 6 - Month 10)

- Develop geomandalas R package to convert geometrical patterns in historical paintings into mandala designs.

- Produce tutorials and open-access resources demonstrating, historical data analysis and mandala creation from historical art using geoms in data visualisation.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address
the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that
follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling
section.

Include concrete actions you will take and estimated timeline.

This project develops an ecosystem of three interconnected R packages to address this problem:

1. museum – a curated database of historical paintings and artifacts with structured metadata.

2. museumguide – an interactive, guided virtual museum for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing artworks using machine learning and image processing.

3. geomandalas – a package that converts geometric patterns from historical artworks into mandalas, supporting creative learning and teaching of mathematics through art.

These packages collectively mirror the human museum learning process:

Observe (museum) → Explore and Analyze (museumguide) → Create / Reflect (geomandalas).

**Benefits to the R Community:**

i. Introduces R users to a new interdisciplinary domain, combining history, art, mathematics, and programming.

ii. Provides open-source tools and datasets for educational use, research, and creative exploration.

iii. Demonstrates innovative applications of machine learning, computer vision, and interactive visualization in cultural heritage.

iv. Encourages contributions from educators, historians, and programmers, fostering community-driven development.

### Minimum Viable Product

<!--
What is the smallest thing you can build that delivers value to your users?
-->

1. Data Package (`museum` R package)

2. Guided Exploration (`museumguide` R package)

3. Turning a painting’s geometry into a mandala using R (`geomandalas` R package)

### Architecture

<!--
What does the high-level architecture look like?
-->

**1. Data Layer (museum package)**

Purpose: Central repository of historical paintings, wall frescos, and artifacts.

Components:

Curated image datasets (scanned or photographed).

Metadata (artist, year, dynasty, location, historical notes).

Preprocessing pipelines (image standardization, glare removal, resolution adjustment).

Function: Provides structured access to all artifacts for analysis and visualization.

**2. Exploration & Analysis Layer (museumguide package)**

Purpose: Virtual guided museum and analysis interface.

Components / Functions:

Interactive gallery (`museum_gallery()`) and artifact display (`museum_art()`).

Guided tour (`museum_tour()`), color palette extraction (`museum_palette()`), map visualization (`museum_map()`).

Machine learning modules:

Geometric pattern detection (`detect_geometric_patterns()`).

Clustering & style classification (`cluster_paintings()`).

Image enhancement (`enhance_painting()`).

Function: Connects users to the data layer and provides analytical tools for educational and research purposes.

**3. Creative / Output Layer (geomandalas package)**

Purpose: Transform geometries from historical artifacts into mandalas for creative learning.

Components / Functions:

Mandala generation from geometric patterns.

Tutorials and exercises for drawing mandalas in R using geom functions.

Book-based examples integrating historical art, geometry, and programming.

Function: Provides hands-on creative exploration, reinforcing learning of geometry, symmetry, and pattern recognition.
